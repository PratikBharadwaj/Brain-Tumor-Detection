# Brain-Tumor-Detection
"Predicting Brain Tumor from MRI-based Medical Image Synthesis using DCGAN and CNN" is a deep learning technique. The paper focuses on generating synthetic medical images through DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) and subsequently employs a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for accurate brain tumor prediction.
